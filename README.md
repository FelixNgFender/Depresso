Mental health crisis is now one of the rising problems in the modern world. Nearly 50 millions Americans are 
experiencing a mental illness, that’s more than the population of California and Texas combined 
[source](#https://mhanational.org/issues/2022/mental-health-america-adult-data).

Depresso can eliminate depression in teens and young adults, the most affected age group, by offering text-based and real-time monitoring of users’s mental health.

Approach
--------
- UI
  - The user interface is a web-based Chrome extension.
  - When Depresso is enabled, it rates the depression levels of the user on a scale of 0 to 10. A rating of 0 would 
indicate low levels of depression, while a rating of 10 indicates otherwise.
  - Depresso suggests professional resources if the user wants additional support.
- Backend
  - The backend consists of a natural language processing model (NLP) to classify depression levels and a Flask server to bridge the NLP and frontend.
  - User-produced text is extracted using Google Docs API.
  - The textual data retrieved is analyzed using the NLP algorithm to produce a prediction
  
NLP algorithm overview
----------------------

At the core of this project is sentiment analysis technique with the pre-trained "en-sentiment" model from the Flair
Project. The Flair sentiment classifer was originally trained on IMDB movie review data. This model produces an output 
label "NEGATIVE" or "POSITIVE" as well as a confidence value to indicate the sentiment of a sentence or a piece of text. 
We have tried several methods, including logistic regression with frequency count vector and TFIDF, and we found that 
Flair's model outperform others in cases of using negation. For example, the traditional logistic regression method 
identified the sentence "I am not happy" as "POSITIVE" because of the word "happy", while Flair's model correctly 
classified it as "NEGATIVE" with high confidence.
